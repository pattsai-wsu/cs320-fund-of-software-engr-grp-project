Description: First the program will ask the user for some inputs corresponding the distribution they want to calculate, the program then read in each input and check if they are
numbers only, if not it will return false and prevent the user from clicking on the "result" botton; if they are numbers, the program then check if the numbers are within the correct range
and if their relationship is correct, note that for discrete distribution to work, the inputs must be within the range and the relationship must be correct, that's why we have different
requirements for different distributions. If the numbers follow the criteria, the program will calculate it and return the result.
